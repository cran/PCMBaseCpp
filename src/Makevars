# This file has the purpose to configure the C++ compilation and building options
# passed as command line arguments to the C++ compiler and linker. The file-contents
# has been tested for portability between Mac OS X and Linux systems but not 
# on Windows. The comments below explain some issues I have encountered and wored
# around while setting up the C++ building environment on Mac OS X.

# The following two lines add compiler and linker options for OpenMP headers and
# shared libraries. Yet, for these options to have an effect, the compiler itself
# should support OpenMP, i.e. it should include the appropriate OpenMP headers,
# and the openmp shared library binaries in its distribution (see above comments).
